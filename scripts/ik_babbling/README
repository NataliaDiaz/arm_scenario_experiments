This folder contains scripts needed to do some babbling, record signals into bag files and extract the latter's data to the disk.

The order in which the different scripts have to be launched :
1. roslaunch arm_scenario_simulator baxter.world (open gazebo, create a rosmaster node, spawn baxter and a table)
2. rosrun ann4smc spawn_environment (this is the script that spawn some object and implements the consequences of actions on objects (e.g a pression on a button switch a light on) )

In order to perform babbling :
3. rosrun ann4smc ik_babbler (thisscripts contains baxter's controler and specify what to record, so that records can be synchronized with the controler)
Alternatively, if you don't need to record synchronizingly with the controler, recording can be performed in a separate ROS node (process) like 
ann4smc recorder

In order to provide a ROS Reinforcement Learning interface* to the simulator:
4. rosrun ann4smc RL_environment


*In most online RL algorithms, it is supposed the learner can interact with the environment through 2 functions:
observation = start([options])
reward, observation, terminal = step(action)
